%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NEED UPDATE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Introduction:
=============

        The constant-pH Molecular Dynamics (MD) method here employed
is the stochastic titration method developed by Baptista and
co-workers.  For details search the references [1-4].
        Each constant-pH MD cycle consists of three sequential steps:
                1st) Poisson-Boltzmann/Monte Carlo (PB/MC) calculation to
assign the solute protonation state.
                2nd) Solvent relaxation dynamics (which allows the
solvent to adapt to the new protonation state).
                3rd) Dynamics of the whole system; in the end returns
to step 1.
        To speed up the process, it is possible to use the reduced
titration approach: every nth cycle a fixed state is assigned to all
the titrable sites whose mean occupancies fall outside a predefined
threshold. This creates an exclusion list with the sites that are
titrating too far away from the pH of interest.
        In this implementation, the method uses proton tautomerism 
in the PB/MC calculations. Here the word tautomer refers to a site 
protonation state and geometry. For a better understanding search 
reference [4-5].
        The dynamics steps use the GROMACS 4.0.7 package. The force
fields available are GROMOS 43A1, 53A6 and 54A7.
        The CpHMD package is also prepared to run in parallel.

Installation:
=============

        In order to use the constant-pH MD package you will need to
install the following programs:

        * GROMACS 4.0.7 (a modified version where ionic strength is
          implemented as an external parameter is also available in
          our website)
        * MEAD (tested with versions 2.2.{0,5,8a,9})
        * Delphi (tested with version V.5)
        * meadTools2.0.1
        * PETIT v1.6.1

Organisation:
=============

        - README: This file.

        - scripts: Here are the CpHMD package specific executable
	  files.
 
        - st-G54a7(_Fit): These are, the directories where the .st
          files for G54a7 can be found.

        - templates: This directory provides examples of each of the
	  input files that should be present at the location where the
	  CpHMD program will run.

        - top: This directory contains the force fields modifications
          to perform constant-pH MD with tautomers (G54a7pHt).

Usage:
======

        CpHMD.sh <runname>.pHmdp

File Formats:
=============

        * <runname>_<index>.pHmdp or <runname>.pHmdp
             -The parameters file of CpHMD-

                This file is the single argument of the CpHMD.sh
executable and contains all the parameter information needed to run
the program. It must be edited according to the user's needs. Take a
copy of the example given in the templates directory, rename it and
change the parameters while maintaining the syntax. Its name will be
used as runname (e.g. Lyso.pHmdp generates files Lyso.edr, Lyso.gro,
etc...and takes information from Lyso.mdp, Lyso.mgm, etc...). When
present, the underscore functions as a separator between the runname
and the block specific index(e.g. Lyso_001.pHmdp generates files
Lyso_001.edr, Lyso_001.gro, etc...and takes information from Lyso.mdp,
Lyso.mgm, etc..., which are common to the different simulation
blocks).
                The list of parameters follows:
        
                - CpHModule: it takes the values *protein* (with the
inclusion of tautomers), *redox* (with the inclusion of tautomers 
and redox groups), *delphi* (with the inclusion of tautomers and 
a titrating lipid bilayer) and *dendrimer* (with the inclusion of 
tautomers and ramified peptide dendrimers)

                - ffID: It takes the value *G54a7pHt*, according to
the force field used

                - pH

                - pot: Electrostatic potential in mV

                - temp: Temperature in Kelvin 

                - ionicstr: Ionic Strength in moles/litre

                - epsin: Dielectric constant of molecular interior
		
		- epssol: Dielectric constant of the solvent 
(to be used in Poisson-Boltzmann calculations) 

                - seed: Monte Carlo seed used in program petit; it can 
be used to generate different replicates.

                - GridSize: This parameter is used to automatically
generate the <runname>.ogm and <runname>.mgm files. When set to zero,
it will be ignored and the files <runname>.ogm and <runname>.mgm are
expected to be provided in the running directory. GridSize stands for
the grid dimension ON_GEOM_CENT when a grid spacing of 1 is used (see
MEAD README for more details) and it depends on the molecule's size.

                - offset : Residue number offset to correct bug in
MEAD (the value should be at least twice the number of residues in the
protein). A value of 0 (zero) bypasses this correction and allows MEAD
to use the whole residue as the titration site. In this case, .st
files with pKmod values from Tanford should be used.

                - Nterminus : If the N-terminus is titrating (present
in the <runname>.sites file) this parameter will be
ignored. Otherwise, it is important to define its state. It takes the
values *CAP* (capped), *CAPpro* (capped proline residue), *CHG*
(charged), *NEU* (neutral), *TAU1* (tautomer1), *TAU2* (tautomer2),
*TAU3* (tautomer3) and *TAU4* (tautomer4). See below (Table I & II; 
Figure 1) for tautomer assignment. In case there are multiple chains,
the assignment should resemble something like this: 
    	       export Nterminus=(CHG CHG)
In this example, the first and second nontitrating Nterminus sites 
will be assigned the charged state.

                - Cterminus : The same as for Nterminus.

                - RTThreshold : Reduced titration threshold. If 0,
reduced titration will not be performed. Otherwise, if the most
populated protonation state for a certain site is bigger than
1-RTThreshold, this state will be attributed to this site which will
not be titrated until the next complete titration occurs.

                - RTFrequency : Reduced titration frequency; number of
cycles between two consecutive complete titrations. Only relevant if
RTThreshold is not 0.

                - RelaxSteps : Number of steps for the solvent
relaxation dynamics. Corresponds to nsteps in the GROMACS mdp file.

                - EffectiveSteps : Number of steps for the whole
system dynamics. Corresponds to nsteps in the GROMACS mdp file.

       		- SOL1st : The name of the first solvent in the input 
gro file (GROin). It separates the solvent block that will be relaxed 
after the atribution of new charges to the solute (also see GROin, below).

                - CpHDIR : Complete path of the CpHMD package
directory (usually the location of this README).

                - StDIR : Complete path of the .st files directory. The
"_Fit" directory should be used together with the "offset"
correction. The older .st files work when the offset is bypassed.

                - GroDIR : Complete path of the GROMACS binaries.

                - MeadDIR : Complete path of the MEAD binaries.

                - DelphiDIR : Complete path to Delphi tools and binaries.

                - MToolsDIR : Complete path of the meadTools1.5
package directory (the CpHMD program is not compatible with older versions
of meadTools).

                - PetitDIR : Complete path of the PETIT package directory.

                - TOPin : Topology of your system (top file). As with
GROMACS the included files must be present in the same directory of
the top file. This file must contain two strings delimiting the begin
and end of the the titrable moleculetype. E.g.

                ; [ begin_tit_molecule ]
                # include "protein.itp"
                ; [ end_tit_molecule ]
                
                or
                
                ; [ begin_tit_molecule ]
                [ moleculetype ]
                ...
                ; [ end_tit_molecule ]

If you wish to add ifdef statements or other definitions different
from the default given by pdb2gmx to the titrable moleculetype, you
should leave them after the "; [ end_tit_molecule ]" string. These
strings delimit the part of the topology that will be allowed to
change during the CpHMD simulations. The rest will remain the same
throughout the simulations.

                - NDXin : The index file of your system (optional).
When the NDXin variable is left empty, an index file will be generated
with the program make_ndx. If the file given by NDXin does not exist, 
an index file will be generated in the same way. Though it is optional, 
bear in mind that the index file made by the CpHMD.sh program may not 
stand in all situations. This may cause the program to crash when running 
grompp. In that case, please provide your own index file. It can be useful 
when simulating in solvent mixtures, for instance.

     		- PDBin : The pdb file of the system. This file is 
necessary to know the number of protein chains and location of the 
several N- and C-termini. The column of the chain indicator (position
22) should be correctly filled. In the case of a single chain, the 
column can and should be empty. This file may contain only the titrable
molecule (protein) or the whole system. In the last case, the other 
molecules of the system (solvent, lipid, ions, etc) should have column
22 empty, as expected, and the protein chains should appear as a block.  
If this variable is empty, the number of chains is considered to be one. 

                - RULEin : The rule file for fix_topology to be used 
when needed. If left blank, it will be ignored.

                - PosRe : Position restraints file (itp file). If you
do not want to use position restraints, just leave it empty.

                - MembraneCenter : Name of the atom to be used as the
membrane center (only in membrane and lipid modules).

                - nCPU : Number of cpus that will run the
simulation. When more than one, the user is responsible for launching
the parallelisation environment (e.g. LAM) before running the CpHMD
software.

                - mdrun : Command for running mdrun. For instance,
when using parallelisation you may want to use mdrun="mpirun C
$GroDIR/mdrun_mpi" or mdrun="mpirun -ssi rpi tcp C $GroDIR/mdrun_mpi" 
and when using single-processor mdrun="$GroDIR/mdrun".

                - InitCycle : First cycle index. E.g.: A simulation
with two blocks of 500 cycles -> Block 1 has InitCycle=1 and
EndCycle=500 ; Block 2 has InitCycle=501 and EndCycle=1000. This
allows maintaining track of simulation time.

                - EndCycle : Last cycle index. See InitCycle example.

                - GROin : Initial gro file. The solvent molecules should 
appear in block in the end of the gro file, after the protein and the 
membrane. The name of the first solvent molecule corresponds to the parameter
SOL1st and it is used to know which part of the gro file was relaxed after
the charge atribution to the solute.


        * <runname>.ogm and  <runname>.mgm

                These files can be provided by the user if the
parameter GridSize in the <runname>.pHmdp is zero. Otherwise, they
will be automatically generated. The <runname> should match the
simulation runname which is defined by the <runname>.pHmdp file (see
above). The format of these files is the one used by the MEAD program
(see the MEAD README for more information).


        * <runname>.sites

                This file corresponds to the .sites file used by
MEAD. It has to be present at the running directory, named with the
simulation runname (see <runname>.pHmdp entry, above). You may use the
program makesites in the meadTools1.5 package to produce this
file. Keep in mind that when running the PB/MC calculations with
tautomers, the .sites file must include all alternative tautomers,
differing from the traditional format.


        * <runname>.mdp

                This file is the dynamics .mdp file. Parameters
defined in the <runname>.pHmdp file will override parameters in the
<runname>.mdp. The solvent must appear as "SOL" to be coherent with
the auxiliary index file generated by the program. Again, the file
must be named with runname (see <runname>.pHmdp entry, above) and be
present at the running directory.

Output:
=======

        * Dynamics
        
                The output from dynamics consists in the regular
GROMACS files: edr, gro, log and xtc (produced by mdrun) and tpr
(produced by grompp). The tpr file is the one produced in the last
cycle, which means that its structure does not correspond to the
beginning of the block.

        * PB/MC

                The output from the PB/MC steps is organised in two
files: occ and mocc. When using reduced titration, additional files
are produced - mocc_red, occ_red and occ_red_mod - which have
essentially a debugging purpose.
                The occ and mocc files contain respectively the output
states from PETIT and the protonation averages of all titrating sites
(columns) in each cycle (lines). For instance, in the first line of
the mocc file we can find the protonation averages in the first cycle
of each site ordered by residue number. By monitoring the occ file we
can always know the solute's state of charge.
                The occ_red and mocc_red are the equivalent to occ and
mocc in the complete titration steps, when reduced titration is
performed. The occ_red_mod contains the most populated state of each
site in the complete titration steps.
        
        * Info

                It is also produced a file containing information
about the user, host and dates of each step of the simulation block -
<runname>_<index>.info.

Notes before use:
=================

	Before starting CpHMD production runs it is expected that the
system (gro and top files) has been correctly initialised (please
consult the GROMACS manual). It is necessary that the gro and top files 
account for the presence of all proton positions. This can be easily 
made by performing the GROMACS setup steps in the presence of the 
modified constant-pH MD force field, present in the CpHMD/top directory. 
The initial pdb file that is given to pdb2gmx must contain the names of 
the titrable residues with the correct residue/tautomer designation (see 
table I below). Also, when solvating/renaming your system, bear in mind 
that the solvent has to be defined as SOL.

     	In the current version, a correction is needed to have the 
Cterminus correctly built after pdb2gmx. That correction is done on the
top file as follows:

awk 'BEGIN{top=ARGV[1]; 
           while (getline < top) if ($5=="O1") r[++j]=$3; 
           close(top)};
     {for (i in r) 
        if (r[i]==$3) 
           {if ($5=="O")  {ga[i] = ($2=="OM") ? 22 : ($2=="OA") ? 19 : 0};
            if ($5=="CA") ca[i]=$1; 
            if ($5=="C") ct[i]=$1}
     } ;
     END{while (getline < top) 
          {write=1;
           for (i in r) 
             {if ($3==r[i] && $5=="O") 
               {print substr($0,1,34)," O2", substr($0,40);
                write=0};
              if (ga[i]!=0 && $1==ca[i] && $2==ct[i] && $3==((ct[i]+4)) && $5=="ga_30") 
               {printf "%5i %5i %5i %5i %6s%2s\n",$1,$2,$3,$4, "ga_", ga[i];
                write=0}
             };
           if (write) print $0}
          }' topol.top > topol_corrected.top

 	After this correction, the top file can be used as usual in the
following minimization/equilibration steps and, later on, it can be given
as the input file TOPin in <runname>.pHmdp. 
        
	If PME is chosen over GRF/RF for long-range electrostatic
treatment, the system should contain the correct amount of
counter-ions that brings the total charge closer to neutrality at a
given pH. Obviously, one needs to run a short CpHMD simulation in
order to determine an average charge of the protein for each pH value.


Solvent Relaxation:
=================

	After the charges being changed in the solute, the solvent
molecules are allowed to move around it in order to find a more
favourable configuration. In this version, this is achieved by performing
a small MD simulation in NVT ensemble with the solute atoms freezed.
The choice of NVT instead of NPT avoids periodic boundary conditions
problems that may arise by fixing some atoms coordinates while changing
the box dimensions at the same time.

    	In the membrane and lipid modules, constraints=none is set as
we expect the solvent to be water and to be constrained by SETTLE.

Default settings:
=================

        PB/MC settings:
        The molecular surface is defined by a rolling probe of radius
1.4 angstroms and the Stern layer is 2 angstroms. The dielectric
constant in the solvent is 80. Each cycle performs 100 000 MC steps,
after 1000 steps of equilibration. Each MC step consists of a
cycle of random choices of state for all sites and pairs of sites with
a coupling above 2 pKa units.
