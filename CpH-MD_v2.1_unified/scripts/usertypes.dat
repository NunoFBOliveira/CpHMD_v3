;This file only works for: Lipid, Organic, Carbohydrate, Other. As the group 'Other' means "everything" this script always works, as long as the user puts the unaccounted residues in the 'Other' group.
;Protein, DNA, RNA, Ion, Water groups should be in the residuetypes.dat file.
;The correct usage is - residue(1st column) group(2nd column). Example:
