# Rule file for fix_topology.

# Any line not starting with "bond", "angle" or "dihedral" is ignored,
# but the best practice is to leave non-readable lines blank or start
# them with a typical comment character, like #.

# The columns in the readable lines are:
#   1 : type of term (bond, angle or dihedral)
#   2 : function type used by Gromacs.
#   3 to last-1 : residuename_atomname, which may include regular expressions
#   last : Parameters, usually a Gromacs macro (eg, gb_15) or "delete"

# The columns must be separated by one or more spaces and/or tabs, as
# the default field separator (FS) in AWK.

# Equivalent definitions for bonds, angles and torsions are done
# automatically: eg, if the bond AA-BB is defined, the bond BB-AA
# doesn't need to be defined.
